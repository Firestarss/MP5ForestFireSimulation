# Welcome to MP5ForestFireSimulation


## We simulated forest fires near the Yosemite Valley in Python


(*screenshot of simulation in action*)


The spread of forest fires is nuanced driven by nuanced geographic parameters, such as
- Topography
- Wind speed and direction
- Vegetation type

We built our model based on the Alexandridis et. al. model presented in 2008. We retrieved GIS data from various sources and adapted the results for python so we could create our own simulation. We hope you can engage with our code by downloading it as instructed on the [User instructions](UserInstructions.html) page.
